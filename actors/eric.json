The attack or area of effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the Emanation can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation damage anything outside it.
